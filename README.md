### Assignment Description

**Intent:** Utilise interactive media to represent your environment.

**Task:** In groups of 3-4, develop a system that creates a representation of the sensor data from building 11 (available at eif-research.feit.uts.edu.auLinks to an external site.). Your system should allow interaction, exploration and sense-making with this representation. You should provide a number of parameters by which the representation may be customised. No particular format is expected, and novel or lateral representations are encouraged.

**Resources**

Data: You can use the API directly, by following the instructions, or you can download a dataset which will be made available here, and do a static version. You can use a single sensor, a number of the sensors, or all the sensors. You will need to consider how to import, translate and then map the data.

Additionally, drawings of the different levels of the building will be made available here.

Consultation: If you have any questions or want feedback on a preliminary version of your code you can ask at the Assignment 2 Questions forum.

**Submit:**

1. A code folder including all libraries, data files, class files, and a compiled executable.

2. A video (unlisted youtube URL is fine) or animated gif of 30 secs duration showing the main features.

**Groupwork:** This is a group assignment. Please submit once for your group only.
